"""Kaomoji canonicalization, validation, and extraction.

The public v1.0 surface is everything in this module. Bumping any
of `KAOMOJI_START_CHARS`, `is_kaomoji_candidate`, `extract`, or the
canonicalization rules below is a major version bump — the central
HF dataset declares "v1 corpus only" against these invariants.

Pilot-specific affect labels (`+1 happy / -1 sad`, `+1 angry / -1
calm`, etc.) live with the research-side code in
``llmoji-study/llmoji_study/taxonomy_labels.py``. They were here in
v0.x; the v1.0 split extracts them because they're gemma-tuned and
have no place in a provider-agnostic public package.

Extractor notes:
  - `extract` returns a `KaomojiMatch` containing the validated
    leading kaomoji span (or `""` if the input doesn't look like a
    kaomoji-prefixed message).
  - The fallback is a balanced-paren span, so whitespace-padded
    kaomoji like ``(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )`` surface with a human-readable
    `first_word` even when no exact taxonomy entry exists.
  - For research-side label lookups, see
    ``llmoji_study.taxonomy_labels.extract_with_label``.

# Canonicalization: collapse trivial kaomoji variants
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Two kaomoji can differ in five cosmetic-only ways that we collapse, and one
# semantically-meaningful way that we preserve.
#
# Cosmetic (collapsed):
#
#   A. Invisible format characters: U+2060 WORD JOINER, U+200B/C/D zero-width
#      space/non-joiner/joiner, U+FEFF byte-order mark, U+0602 ARABIC
#      FOOTNOTE MARKER. Qwen occasionally emits these between every glyph
#      of a kaomoji, e.g. `(⁠◕⁠‿⁠◕⁠✿⁠)` is the
#      same expression as `(◕‿◕✿)`.
#   B. Half-width vs full-width punctuation: `>`/`＞`, `<`/`＜`, `;`/`；`,
#      `:`/`：`, `_`/`＿`, `*`/`＊`. Hand-picked over NFKC because
#      NFKC also compatibility-decomposes `´` and `˘` into space + combining
#      marks, which destroys eye glyphs in `(っ´ω`)` and `(˘▽˘)`.
#   C. Internal whitespace inside the bracket span: `( ; ω ; )` is the same
#      as `(；ω；)`. Strip only ASCII spaces; non-ASCII spacing characters
#      are part of the face.
#   D. Cyrillic case: `Д`/`д` co-occur in the same `(；´X｀)` distressed-face
#      skeleton at near-50/50 ratio, so the model isn't choosing between
#      them semantically. Lowercase all Cyrillic capitals U+0410–U+042F.
#   E. Near-identical glyph pairs:
#        E1. Degree-like circular eyes/decorations: `°` (U+00B0 DEGREE SIGN),
#            `º` (U+00BA MASCULINE ORDINAL), `˚` (U+02DA RING ABOVE) all fold
#            to `°`. Gemma's `(°Д°)` and `(ºДº)` are the same shocked face.
#        E2. Middle-dot variants: `・` (U+30FB KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT) and `･`
#            (U+FF65 HALFWIDTH KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT) fold to `・`. Qwen's
#            `(´・ω・`)` and `(´･ω･`)` are the same expression. Smaller-size
#            middle dots (`·` U+00B7, `⋅` U+22C5) are NOT folded — they
#            could plausibly be a distinct register.
#   F. Hand/arm modifiers at face boundaries: `(๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ` vs `(๑˃ᴗ˂)`,
#      `(っ˘▽˘ς)` vs `(っ˘▽˘)`. Stripped at the bracket boundary only —
#      same face with or without an arm reaching out.
#
# Semantically meaningful (preserved):
#
#   * Eye / mouth / decoration changes that aren't covered by E1/E2 above.
#     `(◕‿◕)` vs `(♥‿♥)` vs `(✿◕‿◕｡)` are distinct expressions.
#   * Borderline mouth-glyph case `ᴗ` vs `‿` is unified to `‿` since the
#     model emits both in the same `(｡ᵕXᵕ｡)` skeleton with no distinct
#     register.
#
# Order of operations matters:
#   1. NFC normalize (preserves `´`, `˘`, `｡` which NFKC would mangle).
#   2. Strip invisible / cosmetic-overlay characters (A + G) — must be
#      early so they don't interfere with subsequent regex / equality
#      checks.
#   3. Apply `_TYPO_SUBS` (B half/full-width + E1 degree + E2 middle-dot
#      + H curly-quote + I bullet→middle-dot + J bracket-corner-circle).
#   4. Strip internal whitespace (C).
#   5. Cyrillic case fold (D).
#   6. Apply ``_INTERNAL_SUBS`` substring substitutions (K
#      ``・-・`` → ``・_・``).
#   7. Strip arm modifiers (F + L).
#
# New rules added 2026-04-27 to catch cosmetic variants that survived
# the rules-A-through-F pass:
#
#   G. Combining strikethrough overlays U+0335–U+0338 over an eye
#      glyph: ``(๑˃̵‿˂̵)`` and ``(๑˃‿˂)`` are the same expression,
#      with U+0335 (COMBINING SHORT STROKE OVERLAY) cosmetic-only.
#      Treated like rule A invisibles.
#   H. Curly quotes fold to ASCII straight quotes:
#        U+2018/U+2019 (single) → ``'`` (U+0027)
#        U+201C/U+201D (double) → ``"`` (U+0022)
#      ``┐('～`;)┌`` and ``┐(‘～`;)┌`` are the same expression with
#      different leading-quote glyphs.
#   I. Bullet ``•`` (U+2022) → middle-dot ``・`` (U+30FB).
#      ``(´•ω•`)`` and ``(´・ω・`)`` share the same skeleton; the
#      bullet glyph is bigger but in this corpus they're being used
#      interchangeably.
#   J. Bracket-corner circle ``◍`` (U+25CD CIRCLE WITH VERTICAL FILL)
#      → ``｡`` (U+FF61). ``(◍•‿•◍)`` and ``(｡•‿•｡)`` share the
#      skeleton. This is the most aggressive of the new rules — the
#      glyphs differ in size more than the others — but in the
#      corpus the role they play (bracket-corner decoration flanking
#      the body) is identical.
#   K. ``・-・`` substring → ``・_・``. Targeted; preserves
#      ``(´-ω-`)`` (where the ``-`` is a tired-eye glyph between
#      ``´`` and ``ω``, not a mouth between two eyes).
#   L. ``*`` ASCII asterisk at face-boundary positions becomes a rule-F
#      arm modifier (alongside ``っ``, ``c``, ``ς``, ``ﻭ``).
#      ``(*•̀‿•́*)`` collapses to ``(•̀‿•́)``.
